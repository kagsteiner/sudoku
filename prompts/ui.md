LLM used: Gemini 2.5 pro - I've read a rave review of this LLM today, so I had to try it out with some serious reasoning :-)

Task: create a native GUI in Python to play Sudoku with puzzles generated, and with a solver that can check if you're on the right track.

Prompt:
You are an expert python developer.


Below you find python code that can solve and generate sudoku puzzles.


Please write python code for a tk user interface that allows users to solve sudoku puzzles generated by this code. The UI shall have these features


* button to generate a new puzzle, with a difficulty between 1 and 10. Based on the difficulty, use generate_random_start_board, followed by generate_sudoku(startboard, difficulty).

* see the sudoku in standard sudoku layout with clearly separated 3x3 spaces. Use large cells. A cell holds up to 9 very small numbers of what the user thinks are possible numbers, and one large number with the value for the cell the user chose.

* possibility to click into a cell which marks the cell as active

* a toggle (you decide which kind) that decides what happens if the user types a number. If the toggle is "domain" (please find a better word) then you add/remove one of the small numbers. If the toggle is "value" (please find a better word), then you enter the actual value of the cell.

* a button to check whether the solution is still valid, with appropriate means of showing this to the user.

* a restart button

* a "new puzzle" button

(rest of prompt is the code generated by ChatGPT from the prompts in solver_and_generator.md)



Result: worked out of the box. That was stunning. It even had features I had not requested but that make sense; but its internal reasoning log showed that this was not just dumb copying of someone else's sudoku code but a conscious decision to include this code.

Even more stunning: Gemini looked at the solver / generator code I had pasted into the prompt, and chose to pretty much ignore it and create its own generator / solver loosely based on the ideas from the code, but significantly different. Also worked out of the box, but really unexpected that a) it didn't need the clever code I came up with with the help of ChatGPT.


Task: I noticed that it is clumsy to use the mouse to switch between final value and pencil notes.

Prompt:
Very cool! Can you suggest code changes to support switching between entering final value / pencil notes with a single key press? 

Result: updated _key_press function that I used to replace the old one. Worked out of the box.





Conclusion: 
Writing a full sudoku - solver, generator, UI, today takes only a few prompts and a state of the art LLM.

It is doubtful whether the code that was generated is not just a copy of someone else's sudoku code that the LLM reproduces; however, I believe my method to create the sudoku is uncommon, and the LLM generated it well; also all my requirements for the UI and parameters and such have been nicely taken into account; and the reasoning shows that the LLMs conciously decide on how to write the code, so I'm strongly leaning towards "the clever LLMs can build this kind of code".
